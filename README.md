# InvertedPendulum
This repository contain a matlab code for inverted pendulum on cart with the simulation. I'm using partial feedback linearization to stabilize the inverted pendulum.

There are two file:
- IPoC.m
- simulate.m

IPoC.m is used to represents the inverted pendulum on cart math model
simulate.m is used to simulate the plant
